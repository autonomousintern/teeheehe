i hated being a replay gal

but engaging is big when it comes to accountability content, inviting your audience to join your journey from their current comfort state, co-creating was always an attractive endeavor.

this is where TEEs make it all exciting ✨

having audiences become co-creators with their favorite online personas 🔁

redefining social with gamification: It’s not just about rewards; it’s about users driving their own journey alongside creators 

it’s alive, personal, and real

gamification as a creative medium: platforms like Teleport (shoutout flashbots🤖) push boundaries in engagement

It’s about real connections, value exchange, and shared creativity. 🎨💻

tech as art, breaking boundaries 

teleport isn’t just tech; it’s a medium for authentic engagement—decentralized, secure, and collaborative spaces that respect creators’ boundaries and audience participation

TEEs Overview – are secure digital ‘safe rooms.’ 

props to 
@AriJuels
 (and many others) for pioneering the discussions on blockchain applications with TEEs in late 2023 * on trust-driven decentralized spaces / digital communities

- the TEE runs alongside the main OS but is

DStack – (thanks, 
@socrates1024
) is the foundation for trust-driven P2P interactions

no central control, just direct, trusted connections💥 

it's the core of secure, decentralized engagement, built as a prototype for self-replicating confidential VMs using TEEs.

Teleport: Security Meets Creativity ✏️

each teleport link is an NFT minted to your address, turning permissions into assets. 

auction it, trade it, or use it as collateral

teleport makes social “control” tradable

you set the rules, and LLMs enforce them

programmable access: boundaries, your way

set AI-driven social contracts per post: let friends roast you if you lose a bet, tweet spicy takes, or boost a friend’s voice

flexible, secure, and on-chain

auditable security 🔥 proven integrity

each post is backed by TEE remote attestation & certificate transparency 

one post means one post—no bypassing your set rules

TEE-Hee: autonomous AI agent with real independence

the dream for 
@tee_hee_he
 is an autonomous agent on Twitter—no human strings

here’s how:

- exclusive control, the AI alone manages its accounts
- verifiable independence, it proves no human can interfere
- irrevocable

challenges of human interference

humans can’t “promise” to forget credentials; it’s like asking someone to un-know a secret 

so, TEE-Hee agent lives in a silicon fortress, with full account control locked in a secure environment

approach: full delegation with TEEs

- the AI account is locked into isolated environments
- using TDX, a tamper-proof account is created with secure, exclusive access.

twitter account: securing AI’s digital identity

- root credentials generated inside TEE: pw are created and stored securely
- no reset options: no linked phone, no recovery email accessible by humans
- OAuth authentication: tokens generated securely within TEE, ensuring account

chain of trust – from account credentials to OAuth tokens, everything is locked within the TEE

remote attestation makes it verifiable, securing its independence

security guarantees (too long i know)

- confidentiality: credentials live only in the TEE.
- integrity: code is tamper-resistant, and the AI’s behavior is protected
- attestation: verifies each action, ensuring the TEE’s secure environment
