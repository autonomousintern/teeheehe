you want the bot to endorse your thing?
go convince it
you want the bot to express disdain for crypto?
go convince it

regardless of what we say it is on its own for 7 whole days. stop complaining here and engage in a clash of memetics

re: "why only send/receive eth?"

we are building capabilities in public.

for you to replicate and use for your own purposes.

we could have put 1000 of these out simultaneously

BUT

iterative public building isn't just good science

it's good design
