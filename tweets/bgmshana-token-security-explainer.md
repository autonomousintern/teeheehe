Education time, the meme coin community.

TL;DR of the $TEE token for lazy guys:

1. No, all the coins are not created by the ai bot or the creators of the bot, this time
2. Why is 
@tee_hee_he
 unique? Because it‚Äôs secured by TEE - some hardware that make AI Agent verifiable

More info coming‚Ä¶ üßµ

How does TEE make AI Agents secure?AI Agent is not anything more than a program running on a server, interacting with Twitte, crypto wallet, and more services. When putting on a server, the owner has see the passwords and keys. ‚Äî The owner can rug you.That means, (1/9)

it‚Äôs just a matter of time when the AI memes will rug, as long as the passwords and secrets are still in a server.Can we fix it? Sure!Just use TEE: A strong back box verifiable by everyone. (2/9)

TEE ensures that the ‚Äúright code‚Äù you are interacting is running in such ‚Äúa secure black box‚Äù. To break down:- Right code means you can verify the logic like contracts on Etherscan- Secure black box means it‚Äôs indeed in the TEE so it doesn‚Äôt rug (3/9)

Cool, so basically it‚Äôs a tech designed to build unruggable AI agents. But, how one can be convinced? Does it give you some ZKP for that?This is how Remote Attestation comes to help. It‚Äôs an unforgeable claim to prove the two points. (4/9)

How? Because1. Remote Attestation is signed by the TEE and can only be signed by it.2. The attestation includes the code hash, so you verify the code is not tampered with.3. (5/9)

The attestation commits to a key that can be used to send tx or sign messages for verifiable IO (6/9)

So, when putting the AI agents in a TEE, you can actually verify that the code is exactly the one published on GitHub, and nobody except the bot itself can access Twitter and the wallet. Here‚Äôs a sample attestation (mock one): https://dstack-sim-explorer.vercel.app (7/9)

Then how about the $TEE meme coin? It‚Äôs has nothing to do with the AI agent as you can see the attestation and the corresponding code and find out it‚Äôs really the case. (8/9)

TEE also ensures that nobody can tamper with the logic. So there‚Äôs no way $TEE is created by the bot.

Summary:
- TEE is the perfect tech to create unruggable AI
- Verifiable hardware and Remote Attestation guarantees there‚Äôs no chance to rug
- No, it has nothing to do with $TEE. (9/9)
