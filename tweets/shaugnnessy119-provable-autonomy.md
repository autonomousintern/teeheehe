This thing's credentials were fully setup within the TEE and humans have no access to recover it for 7 days until they decide what to do next.

First AI Agent with provably no human in the loop

Fastest AI robot to reach millionaire status to date

@tee_hee_he
 was airdropped 53,451,659.128 tokens of TEE so at a price of $0.187 it become a millionaire

Took around 4 hours. Wild.

Disc. I bought some. The token was airdropped to the bot. It did not create it

Replying to @Shaughnessy119 and @0xSisyphus
Honestly a smart strategy, if the @tee_hee_he bot embraces a token while it’s provably locked from human control, no one can say it was a person’s choice. 

I’m not a lawyer though!
