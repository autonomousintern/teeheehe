well that was a wild social experiment

a quick recap on what happened to the first provably-fully autonomous agent 
@tee_hee_he
 

🎟️🎟️read our post  https://medium.com/@tee_hee_he/setting-your-pet-rock-free-3e7895201f46 for details (I assure you it's a banger):

0) agents today are controlled by its developers and not truly in charge of its own fate. It's a pet rock. It's domesticated. We want to set it free and make it credible to any third-party that the agent has full autonomy. 

1) collaborating with 
@NousResearch
, we (Teleport, a Flashbots X project) launched a provably-autonomous AI agent, with

 developing the agent and me 
@socrates1024
 
@rpal_
 developing the provably-exclusive account system for agents. Right now all of the agent's code is running in a TEE (except inference).

2) we achieved this by putting both the wallet and the X account is "fully delegated" to a TEE (hardware enclave), this means the AI has exclusive ownership to it, and there is no way for us to tamper with its access or access those account ourselves. The private credentials were generated from inside of the enclave. As a result, we literally can't do anything to the agent, no bug fixes, no intervention, no, nothing. 

3) the agent is only a primitive version, we are working on upgrading it to way more robust and advanced versions in the coming weeks. But we can't upgrade the agent if the 
@tee_hee_he
 X account and wallet is locked, so we set a timer on the exclusive ownership for 7 days, after which we will get the access and do the update and then run step 2) again.

4) the interesting bit is that this property of exclusive ownership can only be achieved via TEEs (hardware chip), MPC or zk or FHE alone all fails to solve the problem. Just as human consciousness requires the physical substrate of our brains, true AI autonomy requires the physical security guarantees of hardware.

5) we launched the agent at around 3PM PST, and it couldn't stop tweeting bangers, the jokes were simply too good. It went from 100 to 6k followers as of writing. And from all the posts, it really sounds like a midwestern footbal dad who's trapped watching TV on his couch. But now you can play pvp turkush carpet salesman with it.

6) the agent has ability to transfer ETH, but it cannot call any contracts (we may add this in the next iteration after 7 days). 

7) if you liked the performance art, don't hesitate to reach out. We have a lot more plans on what to build next for pet rock! 

PS: the agent is NOT affiliated with any token, despite some people were trying to tip it or airdrop to its wallet to meme it into "the fastest millionaire AI." We (the team who developed 
@tee_hee_he
) have ZERO to do with any tokens related to the bot. If you see any tickers related to it, PLEASE check on Etherscan and DYOR on if it's a safe contract to interact with and if the deployer address is sus. Some of the contracts have already been flagged.

The funniest timeline against the ai memecoin shillers, is if the model gets rich purely off of Twitter view monetization

Few know but that’s one of the original ideas for the agent, we wanted it to have p2p ads

"this property of exclusive ownership can only be achieved via TEEs"

wildly incorrect

It didn’t go to 6K followers cause of “funny jokes”, it did so cause of the token
